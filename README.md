# Module-6-Challenge

A thorough Python project called WeatherPy Analysis was finished for the API challenge in Week 6. There are two main parts to the project: In order to examine weather trends in more than 500 cities at different distances from the equator, we first created a Python script using the OpenWeatherMap API and the citipy package. In order to display the correlations between latitude and different weather variables (temperature, humidity, cloudiness, and wind speed), scatter plots were created. This was followed by the computation of linear regression analyses for both the Northern and Southern hemispheres. The second part used the geoViews Python package and the Geoapify API to generate interactive map representations. After storing the results in a dataframe and filtering cities according to optimal weather, we found hotels within 10,000 meters of our desired coordinates.The project successfully illustrated the usefulness of API integration with Python for weather monitoring and travel planning by producing intricate map visualizations showing these hotel locations.
